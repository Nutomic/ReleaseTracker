ReleaseTracker
==============

An app I made to learn Android programming. Development was stopped when my phone broke.
I only recently fixed some leftover bugs, but don't expect everything to work.  

It keeps track of future movies and notifies the user when a selected movie is released.  

A [TMDB](http://themoviedb.org/) API key has to be placed in `res/values/values.xml` value `api_key_tmdb`.
